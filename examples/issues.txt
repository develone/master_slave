Need separate files for main and thread. Done master.c & mythread.c 
Need a master_slave header. Done
At present the mysvd is executed 3 times and each thread id is executed 1.
If reading or writing a file error is encounted need to not process the thread id.
Memory is allocated for each thread id requires a by-pass if the thread id is to be called more than once.

When trying to adapt mytread.c & master.c which would be ultibo_th_svd.c requires the -E option buildlib.sh
master.c returns an int ultibo_th_svd.c returns a void

All of the pthread types and functions are defined in include\pthreads.h but you need to define _POSIX_THREADS in order to use them.

Try adding -D_POSIX_THREADS to your make parameters (CFLAGS ?) or cmake settings, the same place where you are setting -D__DYNAMIC_REENT__ should work.
